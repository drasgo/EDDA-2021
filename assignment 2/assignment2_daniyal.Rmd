This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}

search=read.table(file="F:\\Downloads\\search.txt",header=TRUE)

search$skill <- factor(search$skill)
search$interface <- factor(search$interface)
is.factor(search$skill); is.factor(search$interface)
```



Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

anova(am)
```
## H0: All the interface times are the same
# For all paramterized interface alpha value, p < 0.05 Hence H0 is rejected/ The interfaces have different search times
# Interface 3 (4.6 times more than interface 1)
# Interface 1 and skill 1
# 
```{r}
summary(am)
```
#2d
# Do friedman test with interface as factor of interest and skill as the block the factor is tested against
#H0 there is no interface affect on search time
#p value < 0.05. H0 rejectedd. H0 rejected, interface does impact search time
```{r}
friedman.test(search$time,search$interface,search$skill)
```
#2e
#to do one way anova we ignore skill factor, hence, each interface type has had atleast 5 students try it
#H0 the factor interface is not significant in the search time, meaning each interface will have similar search time.
#p >0.05 H0 not rejected. Interface is significant to search time, hence each interface will have a different search time.
```{r}
anova(lm(time~interface, data=search))

#4a: Since the test does not change, it is not of relevance whether the test is interpreted as a that for independence or homogeniety. BUt the test of homogeniety suits the best for this use case
```{r}
austen=read.table(file="F:\\Downloads\\austen.txt",header=TRUE)
austen
```
#4b. We do chisquares test on data but without including Sand2, so that we can observe consistency within Jane Austens own work
#H0: The works are homogenous, i.e. the distributions over row factors are equal
#p > 0.05 and hence H0 cannot be rejected, the distributions are equal

```{r}
z=chisq.test( austen[, 1:3])
z
```
```{r}
residuals(z); qqnorm(residuals(z)); plot(residuals(z))
```


#4c. We do chisquares test on data but  including Sand2, so that we can observe consistency within Jane Austens own work and that of the immitator
#H0: The works are homogenous, i.e. the distributions over row factors are equal
#p < 0.05 and hence H0 can be rejected, the distributions are not equal, the work of the immitator differs considerably that to that of jane austen
